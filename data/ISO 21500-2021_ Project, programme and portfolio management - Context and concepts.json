Figure 1 illustrates that opportunities and threats can be identified through organizational strategy and objectives. The opportunities and threats can be evaluated and further developed into requirements and business cases. Based on those business cases and using portfolio management or another management structure, the organization selects and authorizes projects and programmes that provide deliverables, outputs and outcomes to operations. When used in operations, deliverables, outputs and outcomes should contribute to realizing benefits for internal and external stakeholders.

Operations are conducted by relatively stable teams through ongoing and repetitive processes and are focused on sustaining the organization. Projects are performed by temporary teams and provide deliverables, outputs, outcomes and benefits. A project can be managed as a stand-alone work effort within an organization or as part of a larger programme or portfolio. Programmes are groups of programme components managed in a coordinated way to provide advantages and synergies, contribute to the achievement of common strategic and operational objectives, and realize benefits.

These concepts include, but are not limited to: — strategic alignment: projects, programmes and portfolios should be linked to organizational strategy and objectives; — continuous justification: continuous business justification should be used to confirm that expected benefits can be realized and risks managed, and should be used to terminate work when business justification is no longer supported; — appropriate framework: governance and management frameworks and controls should be proportionate and appropriate to the work being performed, the risks associated with it and the organization's acceptable level of risk; — stakeholder engagement and communications: deliverables, outputs and outcomes should meet the agreed needs expressed by the sponsoring organization and should be accepted by stakeholders; — clear roles and responsibilities: authority and accountability should be defined and assigned, consistent and traceable across all levels of a project, programme or portfolio; — appropriate planning and management: work should be appropriately planned and quality should be actively managed; ways of working should be tailored to maximize the likelihood of success within a project, programme or portfolio environment; — continuous improvement: experience and lessons learned should be captured within the organizational knowledge base, which should be shared and used to promote future project, programme or portfolio performance improvement. An integrated governance and management approach for projects, programmes and portfolios, including the foregoing concepts, should contribute to: — building a common understanding of the organization's strategies, objectives, plans and roadmaps; — developing a focus on the realization of strategic objectives; — enabling transparency and alignment of the contributions to strategic objectives; — facilitating communication; — enabling transparency of resource utilization and the reasons for resource usage; — making progress clearer through consistent reporting, decision gates and escalation procedures. The use of project, programme and portfolio management, combined with governance, can provide guidelines, frameworks, processes and tools to create deliverables, outputs and outcomes to realize the intended benefits.
